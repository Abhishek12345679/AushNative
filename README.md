## MOTIVATION TO BUILD IT

I was not satisfied with existing Medicine Delivery Apps because they add a learning curve for the older non-tech savvy people of the country. 
And with our app anyone can just scan their empty medicine pack to order more or simply follow the traditional route by typing and ordering.
