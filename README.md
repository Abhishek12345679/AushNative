Want your meds ? Just Whip out your phone and snap a photo of the packaging and boom it shows you all the meds matching your med's name in our database
Why Aushadhalay instead of other apps:

- Unlimited range of Medicinal Products 💊
- Intuitive 🐝
- One Scan away from your meds 🕵🏼‍♀️ 🕵🏼‍♂️

## MOTIVATION TO BUILD IT

I was not satisfied with existing Medicine Delivery Apps because they add a learning curve for the older non-tech savvy people of the country.
And with our app anyone can just scan their empty medicine pack to order more or simply follow the traditional route by typing and ordering.
